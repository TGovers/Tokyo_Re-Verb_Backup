## Installation Guide 

For Mac users, we recommend cloning/downloading the repository to your computer and installing the plugin through the easy-to-use DMG installer. Simply mount the disk image/DMG (TokyoReVerb_MAC.dmg) and then open the .pkg file found inside. Follow the instructions within the .pkg installer and you'll be good to go!

For Windows users, we recommend downloading the repository to your computer and installing the plugin through the easy-to-use EXE installer (TokyoReVerb_WINDOWS.exe)

If using the JUCE project directly, please refer to a youtube guide or the JUCE website if you are unsure on how to begin! We recommend this [video by Miskat Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGzSSNjbXlA "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGzSSNjbXlA") or the [JUCE Tutorials Page](https://juce.com/learn/tutorials "https://juce.com/learn/tutorials").

## Tokyo Re:Verb In-depth 

Tokyo Re:Verb was primarily built with [Projucer](https://juce.com/ "https://juce.com/")/[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ "https://developer.apple.com/xcode/") as a plugin suited specifically to those who maybe don’t know their way round plugins, but are wanting something cool and intuitive to add that extra “oomph!” to their work.

It utilises an always-active low-pass IIR filter and an optional reverb. IIR filter stands for an Infinite Impulse Response filter, which is unique with how the decay never really reaches zero (to put it simply!). We choose to use this as we personally thought it sounded the best out of the different kinds of filters that we tested. 

The IIR filter has two parameters that you can change; the frequency Cutoff and the Q-Factor. 
* The Cuttoff knob changes the maximum frequency that the filter will let through (as a low-pass filter)
* The Q-Factor knob changes the resonance or **Q** of the filter

The Reverb feature has four parameters that you can change; Width, Room Size, Damp and Mix 
* The Width knob changes the width of the stereo field
* The Room Size knob changes how 'roomy' you want the reverb to sound 
* The Damp knob changes the damping of the reverb, which can help round of the sound and make it warmer (lower high frequencies)
* The Mix knob changes the wet/dry mix of the reverb and original audio

If you want to essentially “turn off” the reverb, just turn the reverb Mix knob to its lowest value.
